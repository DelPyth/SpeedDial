# SpeedDial
A quick shortcut tool using your numpad. Just press and hold a key of your choosing (default Numpad -) and create a shortcut to use time and time again.

# Notes
- This project uses AutoHotkey-JK to get the job done. You can download it by going [here](https://autohotkey.com/download/AutoHotkey_3.0-alpha.1.zip "Must be compiled."), or by going [here](a "NOT ADDED YET").
- This is not finished! This is the source code to the project, I will send a release when a working, stable version is available for use.
